# SCA-Levelled-Membership-Tasks - Data Science Track
    This repo contains my submissions for the She Code Africa (SCA) Levelled Membership Initiative - Data Science Track.
    The idea behind this is to have each lady who joins the SCA community build up her skill in whatever field sheâ€™s interested in,
    through tasks, projects for different levels created by field experts and technical coordinators/channel leads.

## LEVEL 1 : December 17-27 , 2020 | Challenge Started

**Task :** Complete Lesson 1 & 2 of this [Introduction to Python](https://www.udacity.com/course/introduction-to-python--ud1110) course on Udacity 

**Progress :** Learnt about Python Data Types and Operators, built-in functions, type conversion, whitespace, and style guidelines.

**Thoughts :** .

## LEVEL 3 : January 17-30 , 2021 | Intro to ML

**Task :** 
* A - Complete Lesson 1 & 2 of this [Introduction to Machine Learning](https://www.udacity.com/course/intro-to-machine-learning--ud120) course on Udacity
* B - Create a model to assess the likelihood of death by assessing the severity of patients with cardiovascular diseases, using any ML algorithm of choice. The  dependent (y) column is the DEATH_EVENT.
The dataset is available on kaggle [here](https://www.kaggle.com/andrewmvd/heart-failure-clinical-data)

**Progress :**
* A - Learnt about classification, training and testing, and running a naive Bayes classifier using Scikit Learn.
* B - Created a model to assess heart failure using ... Project notebook can be found [here](#)
               
**Thoughts :** Get familiar with the data!
